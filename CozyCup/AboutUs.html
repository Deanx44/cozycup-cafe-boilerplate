                    <p class="card__text">“I really wanted to have my own business,” I decided to go with coffee, which is something I personally enjoys. I started out with a capital of P6,000, with which she bought a coffee maker, labeled cups and packaging, and basic ingredients
                        that included coffee grounds, milk, and sugar syrup. There were a few people who told me that passion was just a phase, which I pushed to wonder if it was indeed something sustainable that I could do. Me had to create the right
                        coffee blend that would be sellable, market it online, and even deliver orders by myself, which gave a lot of room for mishap —such as my car’s battery dying on my mid-delivery but I decided to push through. Little by little, I
                        learned the ropes, and with word-of-mouth doing its magic, I was able to create more flavors and add pastries to my business menu.</p>
